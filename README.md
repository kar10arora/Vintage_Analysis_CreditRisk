This project focuses on Vintage Analysis in the context of credit risk management.
It organizes accounts into cohorts based on their origination date and analyzes their
performance over time, revealing trends in delinquencies and defaults. 
The analysis includes essential data checks, followed by calculations of key metrics
such as cumulative default rates and roll rates for each vintage cohort.

Visualizations illustrate the findings, enabling stakeholders to identify patterns and 
make informed decisions regarding credit risk strategies. This comprehensive approach enhances 
the understanding of how different loan vintages perform, ultimately 
supporting better risk management and portfolio optimization.
